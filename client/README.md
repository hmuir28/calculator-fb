# General Information
This project was implemented as part of my university student duties, it is a simple calculator with a firebase database. The firebase data stores the structure of a simple arithmetic operation, for example:

```
num1 operator num2
```

I would like to bring up that the firebase database is not working independently of the user (I know it's weird) in other words is the same data for every single user, but as I said it's a simple calculator to show how compilers destructure an arithmetic operation in the syntactic phase.
